# TAPL type-checker

### Abstract
This repository is an OCaml reimplementation of the programming language and its interpreter described in "Types and Programming Languages" by Benjamin C. Peace.

### Why do I "Re"implement ?
There are two main reasons for this. First, the officially distributed
programs (https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/) do not work with
the current version of OCaml, and have other minor bugs.

Secondly, I am interested in programming language theory, especially type
systems, and wanted to implement and study them.
